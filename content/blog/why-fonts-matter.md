excerpt: I see too many instances of companies deploying Kafka simply as a shiny new
  message bus without any consideration for how it can facilitate a paradigm shift
  to data-driven insights.

It's easy to buy in to the allure of a near real-time data-driven business with actionable insights delighting customers.  
  
Kafka can certainly help with this but the platform itself is no silver bullet, it won't give you that real time business overnight.  
  
I see too many instances of companies deploying Kafka simply as a shiny new message bus without any consideration for how it can facilitate a paradigm shift to data-driven insights.  
  
This shift requires much more than the platform; beyond an event-driven mindset, at a minimum it needs discoverable content, codified governance and an empowered community.  
  
So why is it so hard to really get going with Kafka? What's holding you back?
