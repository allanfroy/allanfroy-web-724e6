I'm a coach, trainer, facilitator and strategist focused on real-time business and event-driven mindset. My mission is to help businesses think beyond the platform to create more ambitious and holistic event streaming capabilities.

> I'm like WD-40 for your company's data; I help ease the movement of information, processes and people, bringing them together into a well-oiled machine. 

I help businesses stay in control of their data, respond to customer needs faster and optimise use of their IT assets, all while improving compliance, security and resilience.

As a strategist, coach and facilitator, I work with data and technology leaders to create strategies for real time business.

As an experienced guide and advocate, I coach individuals and teams to build confidence in a new event-driven paradigm and mindset, helping them break through the unknown, think beyond the tools and overcome traditional data thinking.

I've been working with Apache Kafka, event streaming and Confluent Kafka since 2016. Most recently I've helped two NZ banks migrate legacy data to event streams and build trust in that data through decentralised, community-led data governance and ownership. This democratisation of data supports their cloud transformation strategies and will unlock innovation across the business.

Currently I offer outcome-based services related to democratising data governance, creating real-time business, training an event-driven mindset, Apache Kafka and real-time event streaming.
